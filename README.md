Holboost
===

Holboost is a python wrapper for Coq, the high-order-logic proof assistant. Most of the data structures in Coq are re-defined in python, but in a different style. The goal of holboost is not to perform perfect mathematical proof but to acheive better automation of program reasoning.

This project contains the following parts:

- A Coq plugin to export Coq terms and tasks and obtain the feedback from the python server
